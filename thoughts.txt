Consider optimising the way that the ball checks if it has collided with a brick (i.e. only look at bricks in the same quadrant as the ball, by 
restricting the coordinates and thus the bricks that are checked)




double-check about ball collision at centre of paddle




There seems to be some sort of issue where the ball gets trapped in the wall border when it hits the furthest bit of the paddle very close to the
wall. It might have something to do with how the paddle movement and collision detection work (we might be having phantom collisions).
It  could also have something to do with how the ball is  being moved out of the way of the paddle after a collision




The methods for levels thing in main doesn't seem like the best way to do levels. Perhaps we could use/could have used classes?
